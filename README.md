## Intro
Digital Forensics
- A.K.A computer forensics or cyber forensics
- Involves collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence to investigate cyber incidents, criminal activities, and security breaches.
- Applies forensic techniques to digital artifacts in computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and storage media
- Aims to reconstruct timelines, identify malicious activities, assess the impact of incidents, and provide evidence for legal or regulatory proceedings.
- Important to incident response process, contributing crucial insights and support at various stages.

Key Concepts
- Electronic Evidence: Includes files, emails, logs, databases, and network traffic from sources like computers, mobile devices, and cloud services.
- Preservation of Evidence: Evidence must be preserved with integrity, following strict procedures to maintain authenticity and a proper chain of custody.
- Forensic Process Stages:
  - Identification: Locate potential evidence.
  - Collection: Acquire data using secure, forensic methods.
  - Examination: Inspect data for relevant details.
  - Analysis: Interpret findings to understand events.
  - Presentation: Clearly report results for legal or organizational use.
- Types of Cases:
  - Cybercrime (e.g., hacking, data theft)
  - Intellectual property theft
  - Internal investigations (e.g., employee misconduct)
  - Incident response and data breaches
  - Legal proceedings and litigation support

Basic Steps
- Create a Forensic Image
- Document the System's State
- Identify and Preserve Evidence
- Analyze the Evidence
- Timeline Analysis
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Report and Documentation

Digital Forensics for SOC Analysts
- Post-Incident Analysis: Digital forensics offers a detailed retrospective view of security incidents, helping trace attacker behavior, techniques, and possibly their identity.
- Rapid Threat Identification: Forensic tools quickly analyze large datasets to identify the time of compromise, affected systems, and attack vectorsâ€”enabling swift containment.
- Legal Evidence Collection: Forensics ensures evidence is preserved in a legally admissible way (hashed, timestamped, and logged), supporting legal action post-breach.
- Threat Hunting Enablement: Insights from past attacks (IoCs and TTPs) help SOC teams proactively search for signs of compromise across systems.
- Improved Incident Response: Understanding the full scope of an attack allows for more targeted and thorough responses, reducing risks of lingering threats or repeated breaches.
- Continuous Learning & Defense Improvement: Each incident provides valuable lessons, enabling SOC analysts to anticipate new threats and strengthen defenses over time.
- Proactive Security Posture: Digital forensics transforms from a reactive function into a proactive capability that enhances overall SOC effectiveness and organizational resilience.
